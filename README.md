# NYPNav
An app that aims to help NYP students navigate their daily life on- and off-campus easily.

From translating cryptic module codes into detailed module information to guiding you through your way around the large campus, this is a go-to app for any NYP student's needs.

If I'm being crudely honest, I was quite bored and found it tedious to have to go open up the student portal to go find out which module code means what and built this simple app for myself. I'm happy if it helps others as well!

### Modules Tab

In the modules tab, users can pick from a list of modules using a picker located at the top. Module information corresponding to the selected module is shown below.

Users have the ability to add new modules and edit module information such as required parameters (module code, module name etc.) and even additional parameters (users can add as many of these as they wish).

### E-Services Tab

> Shown in the screenshot above are a default list of e-services that come when you install the app.

In the e-services tab, users are able to select from a range of common NYP related websites that would be accessed often by NYP students. Clicking on any one of these services will bring users to an **in-app browsing experience** where the user can browse the e-service right in the app.

This makes accessing these services much much easier and eliminates the need to create different Safari tabs in the Safari app everytime.

### Campus Map Tab

> The map above shows the NYP campus.

In the campus map tab, users are able to look at the entirety of the NYP campus. In the bottom-right, users are able to toggle between campus and user location modes. This feature aims to help users find their way around the large campus in case they get lost.

This tab utilises [MapKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/mapkit) and [CoreLocation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corelocation) technologies by Apple.

I hope you have a great experience with the app! Thanks for visiting this page!
